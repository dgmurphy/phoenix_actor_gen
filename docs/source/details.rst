Pipeline Details
================


Configuration File
------------------

PHOX_config.ini configures the initial settings for PHOX pipeline and should be included in the working directory.

::

    [Server]
    server_name = <server name for http: site>
    username =  <user name for ftp login to server_name>
    password =  <user password for ftp login to server_name>
    server_dir = <path to directory on the server where subdirectories are located>

    [Pipeline]
    scraper_stem =  <stem for scrapped output>
    recordfile_stem =  <stem for output of monger_formatter.py>
    fullfile_stem =  <stem for output of TABARI.0.8.4b1>
    eventfile_stem =  <stem for event output of oneaday_formatter.py>
    dupfile_stem =  <stem for duplicate file output of oneaday_formatter.py>
    outputfile_stem =  <stem for files uploaded by phox_uploader.py>

Example of PHOX_config.ini
    
::

    [Server]
    server_name = openeventdata.org
    username = myusername
    password = myweakpassword12345
    server_dir = public_html/datasets/phoenix/

    [Pipeline]
    scraper_stem = scraper_results_20
    recordfile_stem = eventrecords.
    fullfile_stem = events.full.
    eventfile_stem = Phoenix.events.
    dupfile_stem = Phoenix.dupindex.
    outputfile_stem = Phoenix.events.20

Web Sources
-----------

It is now possible to code event data from a limited list of sources that is
different from that used within the web scraper. For instance, it might be
desirable to scrape content from a wide variety of sources, but some of this
content may be too noisy to include in an event dataset or there is some
experementation necessary to determine which sources to include in a final
dataset. The data sources are restricted using the ``source_keys.txt`` file.
These keys correspond to those found in the ``source`` field within the MongoDB
instance created by the `web scraper <https://github.com/openeventdata/scraper>`_.


PETRARCH
--------

`PETRARCH <http://petrarch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ (Python Engine for
Text Resolution And Related Coding Hierarchy) is an event coding program used
to machine code even data from formatted source texts in the pipeline. PETRARCH
is the next-generation replacement for the `TABARI
<http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/software.dir/tabari.html>`_ event data
coding software. PETRARCH is dictionary-based and relies on a full parse
generated by natural language processing software such as Stanford's `CoreNLP
<http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml>`_ along with pattern
recognition to identify 'who-did-what-to-whom' relations.
